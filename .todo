Educational Experience:
   ✔ add btn is clicked @done(21-01-18 16:15)
   ☐ the values in education state are passed to a new object in the education array in state
   ☐ the education array is mapped out above the form area, under educational experience


Bugs:
   ✔ when onChange runs in Education, its created a nested Education object.  Should just update the Education object that already exists. @done(21-01-18 16:14)
